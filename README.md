# Predicting AQI - Machine Learning for Air Quality Index Prediction

Welcome to the Predicting AQI project! This repository focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI). The goal is to leverage historical air quality data and environmental features to develop a model that can forecast AQI values.

## üöÄ Features

- **AQI Prediction:** Utilize machine learning models to predict Air Quality Index.
- **Data Exploration:** Analyze historical air quality data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features that impact air quality.
- **Model Training:** Train machine learning models on historical data for accurate predictions.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE and R2 score.
- **Visualization:** Visualize predictions and actual AQI values for better interpretation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core language for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Data visualization for insights.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive development and analysis.

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/prth1234/Predicitng_AQI.git

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Step 3: Explore and Analyze Data
Use Jupyter Notebooks to explore the data (Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb).
Understand the distribution of AQI values, relationships with other features, and potential correlations.
Step 4: Feature Engineering
Identify relevant features that contribute to air quality.
Extract and preprocess features to prepare the data for model training.
Step 5: Model Training
Train machine learning models using historical data (AQI_Prediction_Model.ipynb).
Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters.
Step 6: Evaluate and Visualize
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE and R2 score.
Visualize predictions against actual AQI values for insights.
